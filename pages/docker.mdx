# Docker images for proxies

## First you need to have docker and docker-compose installed



 theses are the steps to install docker and docker-compose on debian
 note that if you are using any other distro that isn't based off of debian you should find the instructions here if you use ubuntu or any other distros [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)



Update the apt package index

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```bash
sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the repository:

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Update the apt package index again

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the latest version of Docker Engine

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli
```

Install docker-compose

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-compose
```

Now you should have docker and docker-compose installed

## You can follow theses steps to get the most use out of the docker images

first run this command

```bash
mkdir -p ~/docker-images/ && \
cd ~/docker-images/ && \
mkdir -p incognito/ && \
mkdir -p hypertabs/ && \
mkdir -p ludicrous/ && \
mkdir -p website-aio/ && \
mkdir -p abyss-browser/ && \
mkdir -p webOS/ && \
mkdir -p metallic/ && \
mkdir -p ruby/
```

Note you don't need to create all of the directories, just the ones you want to use

## Incognito

Access the world wide web with Incognito, a fast and rather fancy proxy service. Enjoy a more private internet session without ads. The second largest scaling proxy service in [Titanium Network](https://discord.gg/unblock)

getting started

First we want to cd into the directory by doing this command:

```bash
cd ~/docker-images/incognito/
```

Now lets make the docker-compose.yml file

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

now copy and paste this into the file

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  incognito:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: "ghcr.io/ruby-network/incognito-docker"
    ports:
      #IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THE 8080 PART ONLY CHANGE THE <your port here> PART
      - <your port here>:8080
# network config if you want a network config feel free to use the one below and change the name to your liking.YOU MUST RUN docker network create <your name> BEFORE RUNNING THE CONTAINER
#networks:
#  default:
#    external:
#      name: default
```

Save the file and exit

Now we can run the container

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Hypertabs

An incredible browser-themed web proxy service.

Now we just do what we did for incognito but we need to change a few commands

```bash
cd ~/docker-images/hypertabs/
```

Now lets make the docker-compose.yml file

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

now copy and paste this into the file

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  hypertabs:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: " ghcr.io/ruby-network/hypertabs-docker"
    ports:
      #IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THE 8080 PART ONLY CHANGE THE YOUR PORT HERE PART
      - your port here:8080
# network config if youi want a network config feel free to use the one below and change the name to your liking. YOU MUST RUN docker network create <your name> BEFORE RUNNING THE CONTAINER
#networks:
#  default:
#    external:
#      name: default
```

Save the file and exit

Now we can run the container

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
