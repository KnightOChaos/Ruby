### Docker Installation

#### Requirements

- Install docker and docker-compose (if you don't have it already)

#### Installation

- Copy the docker compose example below and paste it into a file called `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  ruby:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: "ghcr.io/ruby-network/ruby:main"
    ports:
      #IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THE 8080 PART ONLY CHANGE THE <your port here> PART
      - <your port here>:8080
```

- You can also just simply curl the docker-compose.yml file from github

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruby-Network/ruby/main/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
```

- Change `<your port here>` to the port you want to use removing the `<>` around it.
- Run the docker-compose file

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Docker Only Installation

- Run the following command

```bash
$ docker run -d -p <your port here>:8080 --restart unless-stopped --name ruby ghcr.io/ruby-network/ruby:wq:main
```

- Change `<your port here>` to the port you want to use removing the `<>` around it.
